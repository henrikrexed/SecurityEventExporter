## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@opentelemetry.io](mailto:security@opentelemetry.io)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information (optional)

### Response Timeline

We will respond to security reports within 48 hours and provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability.

### Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis tools to detect potential security issues
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Supply Chain Security**: OSS Scorecard and dependency review
- **Secure Development**: Security-focused development practices

### Security Features

The Security Event Exporter includes the following security features:

- **Secure HTTP Communication**: Support for HTTPS endpoints
- **Authentication**: Configurable API tokens and custom headers
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of configuration and input data
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Logging Security**: Sensitive data is excluded from logs

### Security Best Practices

When using this exporter, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints for security event delivery
2. **Secure Headers**: Use secure authentication headers and API tokens
3. **Network Security**: Deploy in secure network environments
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for the collector
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for security events and anomalies
6. **Updates**: Keep the exporter and dependencies up to date

### Security Configuration

Example secure configuration:

```yaml
exporters:
  securityevent:
    endpoint: https://secure-api.example.com/security-events
    headers:
      authorization: "Bearer your-secure-token"
      x-api-key: "your-api-key"
    timeout: 30s
    default_attributes:
      source: "secure-collector"
      environment: "production"
```

### Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Assessment**: We assess the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test fixes
4. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose vulnerabilities with fixes

### Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after vulnerability assessment and fix development. We recommend:

- Monitoring security advisories
- Updating to the latest version promptly
- Testing updates in non-production environments
- Implementing proper backup and rollback procedures

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact:

- **Security Email**: [security@opentelemetry.io](mailto:security@opentelemetry.io)
- **Project Maintainers**: [opentelemetry/security-event-exporter-maintainers](https://github.com/opentelemetry/security-event-exporter-maintainers)
